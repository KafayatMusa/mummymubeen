        <p>
          My home towm is a small settlement located in a rural setting.
           It is generally larger than a "hamlet" but smaller than a "town." 
           Some geographers specifically define my home town as having between 500 and 2,500 inhabitants.



Some villages are linear settlements. They are not clustered around a central public space,
 but around a line. This line can be natural, such as a river bank or seashore. (Fishing village
 s are often linear settlements.) Linear settlements can also develop around a transportation route,
  such as a railroad line.

Planned villages are communities that do not develop around a central point. They are outlined 
by city planners, often to avoid land-use conflicts that are common in nucleated settlements.

Planned villages are sometimes called "new towns." Tapiola, Finland, for instance, was planned as an "ecological village" or "garden city" in the 1950s. The nonprofit organizations that planned Tapiola were guided by the principles of providing local jobs, including all income levels, and establishing life in harmony with nature and the natural world.

Villages often function as units of local government. In China and Japan, a village is an official administrative unit. An administrative unit is a single component of government, with its own leadership (similar to city councils) and services, such as mail delivery.

         Brief History of Doko
 The origin of the people has not been
 clearly documented. However oral
 evidence has provided an insight into the
 historical beginnings of the Doko people.
 From oral tradition, it is indicated that
 Hama Kolo was the first man who was
 said to have settled at Sakoba. This is the
 place the Doko people as known today
 settled first. The people at Sokoba were
 known as Edoko, meaning plenty.
 Hama Kolo was said to have come from
 the East with a Chieftaincy titles known as
 Defian and Zhitsu . The Hama Kolo also
 had a son called Saba. A time came when
 the Fulanis took away this Saba as a slave
 to Raba ( a village far away beyond River
 Kaduna) to cut grasses as fodder for their
 horses. Later Saba escaped from Raba
 and came to his father Hama Kolo at
 Sakoba. On his way coming, Saba came
 along with the sickle which he used in
 cutting grass for the Fulani horses.
 On his arrival he was asked what he was
 doing at Raba with the sickle. Saba then
 informed the father that he was cutting
 grass for the Fulani horses and that in
 Nupe language is ego doko-gbe . This work
 of Saba then later became the name of the
 settlement hence Doko having his name.
 The descendants of Saba and his father
 are still known in Doko today as Edoko and
 still maintained the titles of Defian and
 Zhitsu!
 Dazhi, another group of people who lived in
 Doko, were two brothers who came from
 beyond the river, from a place called Gara
 ( a village beyond river Kaduna), possibly
 from Benue State. They came to a place
 now called Kopa (Kopa is about five
 kilometers from Doko, on the other side of
 the hill on the slope of which Doko is
 situated). There was nothing in this place
 except bush. They settled there, first as
 hunters and later they began to work on
 the land. After two years the younger
 brother called Lafiya left Kopa and came
 down to the hill to a place called Kokogi
 about two kilometers away from Edoko
 people. Lefiya came with a title of Etsu
 Dazhi, meaning Chief of Dazhi people.
 Lefiya became the first Etsu Dazhi of the
 people in Doko.
 To escape from the Fulani raiders, Edoko
 people moved from Sakoba into the hillside
 where Dazhi people had settled. The Dazhi
 people claimed that the land where Edoko
 people came to settle in was theirs. This
 episode later made the Edoko people to
 surrender their sovereignty to Dazhi
 people, politically. Today, the Dazhi
 people owned the land, economic trees
 and the fish ponds. This is why in Doko
 today we have Dazhi as the political head
 of the village. The other group that formed
 the Doko people apart from the one
 mention above are : Takogi, Kpacinninfugi
 and Dodofugi people. Geography of Doko
 Doko is located on latitude 8 N and
 longitude 5 E. It is a district in Lavun
 Local Government of Niger State. Doko is
 about fifteen kilometers away from Bida,
 sharing boundary with Bida in the North
 and Kwara State in the East.
 Doko is one of the Beni organizations, a
 sub-tribe in Nupe Kingdom. From the foot
 of the two flat-topped hills, the town
 sweeps down into the plains. The land is
 undulating, rugged, and dotted here and
 there with fold ridges. Due to its
 undulating land there are big river valleys
 which run through the village from the two
 flat-topped hills of the Plateau. This
 accounts for Doko been situated on some
 water course, a stream or a brook called
 Danangi,Bokungi , and Santu . Here, women
 fetch water, wash their clothes,
 calabashes and dishes. This is common
 during dry season when almost all the
 wells have dried up in the town.
 Doko, being part of Nupe country, has
 combinations of features from the South
 and North of Nigeria. Nupe, lying lower
 than any of the districts in Nigeria with its
 two big rivers, their dry, blazing sand bank
 in the dry season.
