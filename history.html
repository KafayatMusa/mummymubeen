        <p>
          My home towm is a small settlement located in a rural setting.
           It is generally larger than a "hamlet" but smaller than a "town." 
           Some geographers specifically define my home town as having between 500 and 2,500 inhabitants.



Some villages are linear settlements. They are not clustered around a central public space,
 but around a line. This line can be natural, such as a river bank or seashore. (Fishing village
 s are often linear settlements.)

         Brief History of Doko
 The origin of the people has not been
 clearly documented. However oral
 evidence has provided an insight into the
 historical beginnings of the Doko people.
 From oral tradition, it is indicated that
 Hama Kolo was the first man who was
 said to have settled at Sakoba. This is the
 place the Doko people as known today
 settled first. The people at Sokoba were
 known as Edoko, meaning plenty.
 Hama Kolo was said to have come from
 the East with a Chieftaincy titles known as
 Defian and Zhitsu . The Hama Kolo also
 had a son called Saba. A time came when
 the Fulanis took away this Saba as a slave
 to Raba ( a village far away beyond River
 Kaduna) to cut grasses as fodder for their
 horses.
